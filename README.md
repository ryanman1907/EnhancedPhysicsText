# EnhancedPhysicsText
This rudimentary web-based physics text is the outcome of a final project for the course ECE 495 - Natural Language Processing at Duke University.

The actual textbook is contained in the index.html file and the  LaTex and PDF are first drafts of the text before the web-based page began to take shape. 

For instructions on how to open the app on your own computer, see the writeup, which is also present in this repository.
